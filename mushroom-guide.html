              What do I need to start mushroom foraging?
            </h3>
            <p>
              You'll need a local field guide, a sharp knife or scissors, a
              basket or mesh bag for collecting, and paper bags for separating
              specimens. Bring a small brush for cleaning, wear sturdy boots,
              and carry a GPS device or compass to track your location. A camera
              is also helpful to document your finds.

            <h3 class="card__title">How can I identify edible mushrooms?</h3>
            <p>
              Learn from experienced foragers and reliable guidebooks â€“ never
              rely on apps alone. Study each mushroom's specific features like
              cap shape, gill structure, stem characteristics, and spore prints.
              Start with easily identifiable species that have no poisonous
              lookalikes, and never eat anything unless you're completely
              certain of its identification.

            />
            <h3 class="card__title">Where can I find foraging spots?</h3>
            <p>
              Look in deciduous forests, especially near oak and maple trees,
              and in damp, shaded areas. Fallen logs and dead trees are often
              productive spots. Only forage on public lands where it's allowed,
              and always check local regulations. Remember to get permission for
              private property and keep your best locations private to prevent
              over-harvesting.

              What are the best seasons for mushroom foraging?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Spring is ideal for morels, late summer brings chanterelles and
              boletes, and fall is peak season for most mushrooms including
              oysters and hen of the woods. Some species can even be found in
              winter, especially in milder climates. Each season offers
              different varieties, so year-round foraging is possible.
